> üîé Why `pipx`?
> `pip install --user` is not recommended, as it does not ensure dependency isolation. For this purpose, the [Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/) advises to use [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/). `pipx` installs and runs python CLIs in isolated environments. To install it, follow the instructions [here](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/#install-pipx).
