# ⚡ Feature Overview

## 🍪 `cookiecutter` and `cruft`

`cookiecutter` is a language-agnostic library that leverages `jinja2` templates to build project templates. Upon invocation, end-uses will be prompted to to enter values such as the project name, and in the background `cookiecutter` will create the project directory and configuration files - drastically reducing the amount of boilerplate to write. Variables are defined inside a `cookiecutter.json` file.

`cruft` is another library built on top of `cookiecutter` that allows syncing a project with its cookiecutter. Syncing capabilities are not exceedingly powerful, and `chef` won't likely introduce breaking changes in your setup, but is still a nice to have.
